# User Journey: Finding Dorm Inspiration

Alex, a first-year MIT student, feels anxious about how to style her New Vassar double room and wants to find design ideas that match her space. She opens the MITDormCraft app and begins by navigating to the Register page, where she creates an account using her MIT Kerberos ID, choosing a username and password. After registering, she is redirected to the Home page.

<br>
Here, Alex sees a list of available room templates. She clicks on “New Vassar Double”, and the feed updates below to show a grid of design posts with images and titles submitted by previous students who lived in that same room type. Instantly, Alex feels inspired as she scrolls through the posts, seeing a variety of creative dorm setups ranging from minimalist study spaces to cozy, plant-filled rooms.

She likes several posts that catch her eye and pauses on one featuring warm fairy lights and a neatly organized desk. Curious, she leaves a comment asking, “Where did you get those fairy lights? This setup is amazing!”

<br>
Feeling motivated, Alex decides to share her own dorm transformation journey. She uploads photos of her progress, writes a short caption, and posts it to the feed, hoping to inspire others just as she was inspired. Through this process, Alex not only finds practical decorating ideas but also connects with a community of MIT students who share her passion for creating beautiful and functional living spaces.

This journey demonstrates the core features implemented: registering and logging in, browsing room templates, viewing posts in a grid-style feed, liking and commenting for community interaction, and sharing dorm room designs within the MIT community, all while logged in.
